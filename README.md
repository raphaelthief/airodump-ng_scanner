# Enhanced Airodump-ng Scrolling and Visualization Tool
This Python script builds upon the functionality of Airodump-ng, introducing advanced features that enhance usability and provide more insights during wireless network scanning and analysis.

## UPDATES
### [28 JULY 2025]
- Displays the hashcat command to use, with the hash directly generated individually for each captured PMKID or 4-way handshake, along with the associated ESSID translated from the frames (Hex to String).
- Displays the hashcat command to start the password cracking process using an automatically created .hc22000 file.
- Tracks and updates hashes in the .hc22000 file after each execution. Each hash is unique, and duplicates are ignored.

### [21 JULY 2025]
- Ability to pause the script and resume display by pressing the [space] key while airodump continues capturing in the background.
- Display of captured EAPOL frames (M1/M2/M3/M4) as well as PMKID packets.
- Real-time tracking of captured handshakes and crackable PMKIDs.
- Attack script available with the --attack option. Launches client deauth, broadcast deauth, and various PMKID attacks (see --help for more details). Only reason code 7 is currently used for deauthentication for now.
- Attacks crafted using Scapy and tested for optimal performance based on analysis of packets sent by various tools such as aireplay-ng and hcxdumptool.
- Collection of client ESSID probes for karma-style attacks.

## Features
1. Scrolling and Real-time Updates
Enables smooth scrolling through the Airodump-ng results, overcoming the static display limitations of the original tool.

3. Vendor Information Integration
Automatically retrieves and displays manufacturer details for Access Points (APs) and client devices by parsing the IEEE OUI database.

4. WPS Information Extraction
Extracts detailed WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) information (e.g., version, locked status, configuration methods) from captured .cap files using TShark.

5. Color-coded Relationship Mapping
Introduces a color-coded system to visually link clients to their associated APs, enhancing the clarity of network relationships.

6. Access Point and Client Insights
Displays :
Signal strength with color-coded indicators (strong, medium, or weak).
Encryption details (e.g., WPA, WPA2).
Device manufacturers for both APs and clients.
Real-time activity monitoring with a 4-minute timeout for inactive devices.

7. Automated Network Mapping
Generates network topology visualizations using Airgraph-ng:
CAPR format : Client-to-AP relationships.
CPG format : Peer-to-peer network graph.

8. Robust Error Handling and Debugging
Maintains a detailed debug.txt log for tracing errors and system activity.

9. Dynamic Configuration
Fully configurable scanning parameters (e.g., interface selection, channel filtering).
Supports both saving and auto-cleaning of temporary files.

## Usage
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system :
- Aircrack-ng (for Airodump-ng and Airgraph-ng)
- TShark (for extracting WPS information)
- Colorama (for enhanced terminal output)

## Quick Start
Clone the repository :
```
git clone https://github.com/raphaelthief/airodump-ng_scanner.git
cd airodump-ng_scanner
```

Run the script :
```
sudo python3 scan.py
```
Follow the interactive prompts to select the network interface, configure scan parameters, and manage output.

Advanced Options :
- --get : Retain all output files generated by Airodump-ng in /tmp for post-analysis.
- Automatic manufacturer database download (oui.txt) ensures the latest OUI information.

## Output
- Console View : Real-time display of AP and client details, updated every few seconds.
- Visualizations : Network maps saved as PNG files in CAPR and CPG formats.
